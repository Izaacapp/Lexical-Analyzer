#### Project Description:

This project aims to implement a lexical analyzer for the PL/0 programming language. The goal is to read a source program written in PL/0, identify lexical errors, and produce the source program, lexeme table, and token list as output.

#### Objectives:

The lexical analyzer must:
1. Read a source program written in PL/0.
2. Identify and report lexical errors such as excessively long names or numbers, and invalid symbols.
3. Produce the following outputs:
   - The original source program.
   - A lexeme table that displays lexemes alongside their corresponding token types.
   - A token list representing the sequence of tokens in the source program.

#### Files Included:

1. `lex.c` - Source code for the lexical analyzer.
2. `readme.txt` - This readme file.
3. `input1.txt`, `input2.txt`, `input3.txt` - Sample input files containing PL/0 source programs.
4. `output1.txt`, `output2.txt`, `output3.txt` - Expected output files containing the source program, lexeme table, and token list.

#### Compilation and Execution:

To compile the lexical analyzer, use the following command:
```bash
gcc -g -Wall -Wextra lex.c -o lex
```

To execute the lexical analyzer and compare the output with expected results, use the following commands:
```bash
./lex input1.txt > temp_output1.txt
diff temp_output1.txt output1.txt

./lex input2.txt > temp_output2.txt
diff temp_output2.txt output2.txt

./lex input3.txt > temp_output3.txt
diff temp_output3.txt output3.txt
```

#### Program Structure:

- **Lexeme Structure**: Each lexeme is represented by a structure containing the lexeme itself, its token type, and an optional error message.
- **Reserved Words and Tokens**: The program includes arrays to store reserved words and their corresponding token types.
- **Lexeme Table and Token List**: Functions are provided to print the lexeme table and token list.

#### Error Handling:

The lexical analyzer identifies the following errors:
1. **Name Too Long**: Identifiers exceeding 11 characters.
2. **Number Too Long**: Numbers exceeding 5 digits.
3. **Invalid Symbols**: Symbols that are not part of the PL/0 language specification.

Errors are recorded in the lexeme table alongside the offending lexeme.

#### Lexical Analysis Process:

1. **Reading Input**: The source program is read from the input file.
2. **Processing Input**: Each character is processed to identify lexemes, classify them into tokens, and detect any errors.
3. **Output Generation**: The source program, lexeme table, and token list are printed to the console and can be redirected to an output file.

#### Example:

**Input (input1.txt)**:
```
var x, y;
begin
  y := 3;
  x := y + 56;
end.
```

**Output (output1.txt)**:
```
Source Program:
var x, y;
begin
  y := 3;
  x := y + 56;
end.

Lexeme Table:
lexeme               token type
var                  29
x                    2
,                    17
y                    2
;                    18
begin                21
y                    2
:=                   20
3                    3
;                    18
x                    2
:=                   20
y                    2
+                    4
56                   3
;                    18
end                  22
.                    19

Token List:
29 2 x 17 2 y 18 21 2 y 20 3 3 18 2 x 20 2 y 4 3 56 18 22 19
```
